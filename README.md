# Family Board
Basic tool to display the current day’s info, weather, and custom calendar events to use as an always-on tablet status board

## Installation

- You’ll need a simple webserver with PHP & MySQL support
- Create the database by using the command from /create.sql
- Open /inc/config.inc.php and change variables/constants
- Set up some sort of password protection for the filebase, e.g. via .htaccess
- Nail your tablet against the kitchen wall, open the website on it, and go!
